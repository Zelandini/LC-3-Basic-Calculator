# LC-3 Basic Calculator

This is my first low-level script, built as part of the CS210 assignment. It implements a basic calculator in LC-3 assembly, intended to practice working with registers, memory, and branching logic.

## Assembly file

The calculator logic lives in `LC3-Calculator/A1.asm`. The program reads user input, performs the requested arithmetic operation, and outputs the result using LC-3 traps. Comments in the file outline the control flow and document the purpose of each routine for easier study and modification.
